This is data from the National Center for Education Statistics. Computer science has always been dominated by men, and the situation only seems to be worsening (even while many other scientific and technical fields have made significant strides towards gender parity). According to this research report published by the American Association of University Women in 2015, women computer science graduates in the United States peaked in the mid-1980s at 37 percent, and we have seen a steady decline in the years since then to 26 percent today. However, this report did treat gender as a binary, so there was no data about nonbinary people. 

> The problems of gender and racial bias in our information systems are complex, but some of their key causes are plain as day: the data that shape them, and the models designed to put those data to use, are created by small groups of people and then scaled up to users around the globe. But those small groups are not at all representative of the globe as a whole, nor even of a single city in the United States.

## Data Viz Biography

1. **Who or what institution produced the visualization? (Hint: refer to "Figure Credits")** 

   This data is from Christianne Corbett and Catherine Hill, Solving the Equation: The Variables for Women’s Success in Engineering and Computing (Washington, DC: American Association of University Women, 2015).

2. **When was it produced?** 
   
   2015

3. **Who is the audience for the visualization?** 
   
   all peoples and readers

4. **How might the visualization be interpreted or misinterpreted? What consequences might this interpretation/misinterpretation have?** 
   
   This visualization might be misinterpreted by people who do not closely read the text on the graph. People might see the visualization and read it as the percentage of women who are IN the field of computer science, rather than the percentage of bachelor's degrees in computer science that are awarded to women. This is not a an extremely bad consequence as the premise is similar, but this assumption would not be backed by factual evidence.

5. **How, if at all, does the data visualization represent power or systems? [10 points]** 
   
   The data visualization represents power by showcasing how despite feminism and gender equality becoming increasingly prominent in the world, some fields such as computer science still display trends of a lesser  prescence of women. :pensive:
